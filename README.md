# Music Recommender

This is a project that focuses on one important question: what kind of music would I like to listen to?

For many years people and computers have tried to recommend songs to me to listen to. I reject 99.9999% of them as the music simply does not speak to me the same way it speaks to them. Sometimes, however, my friends do land on things that really make my soul sing. Over time it's become more and more difficult to sit down and go find new music undisturbed. There is also way too much music out there for consumption and that's just the set of music that one can go and find for free on a streaming platform. Imagine all the digital and non-digital music in the world and what a giant set of tunes we are all missing out on.

Music recommendation is by no means a new problem. Spotify and Soundcloud most notably attempt to recommend music to me and sometimes they are good suggestions. I have my own set of ideas that I'd like to try out on music and I think I can make a platform geared towards testing those ideas out.

This project will start off very backend/algorithm heavy as that's really what this is all about and once something looks promising, I intend to open up the top layers of the canopy and expose the algorithmic creatures to the sunny sky of hungry seagulls looking for a delicious song to gobble up.

But real talk now, let's see if I give up within a few days or a week.
